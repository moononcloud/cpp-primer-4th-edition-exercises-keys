Algorithms that Write to a Destination Iterator
A third kind of algorithm writes an unknown number of elements to a destination iterator. As with fill_n, the destination iterator refers to the first element of a sequence that will hold the output. The simplest such algorithm is copy. This algorithm takes three iterators: The first two denote an input range and the third refers to an element in the destination sequence. It is essential that the destination passed to copy be at least as large as the input range. Assuming ilst is a list holding ints, we might copy it into a vector
